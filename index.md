**Insperational Band Quotes**

**"In band we are asked to create an image to show the world, even from a young age to paint an outlined image. Each canvese  is diffrent, as like music. Marching band in particular when learning a new peices of music is hard, but yet we all have diffrent reasons to be there. Although our main reason over all is when we are on that feild nothing else matters. The world is in the palm of our hand, it is our Camalot it is our time to shine. When we play that feeling is exhilarating beyond words".**
- _Lilliana Gonzales_

"Music is your own experiance, your own thoughts your wisdom. If you don't live it, it wont come out of your horn. They teach you theres a boundary line to music. But, man, theres no boundary lined to art"
-Charile Parker

**LEGACY**
 
 As the years come and go as do people. Our section expands and shrinks each year with people coming in, yet our legacy remains, as do our traditions. The imprint that people have on our lives inspires us and drive others to do better. What is the legacy you will leave behind? Who will carry it out? Who will the next Drumline consist of?
 
 **To the Drumline of 2017-2018**
 
 _What will your legacy be to the future generations of The MHS Percussion section?_
 
 _What will be a tradition?_
 
 _Who will you insipre?_
 
 **GOOD LUCK AT TRYOUTS TO OUR FUTURE!**
